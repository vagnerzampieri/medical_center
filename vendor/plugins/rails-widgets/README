Rails Widgets for Rails 3
=======

This is a version of paolodonas rails-widgets that works with Rails 3

Right now only tabnav, tooltip and navigation work

Rails Widgets is a collection of UI Widgets for RubyOnRails (in form of ActionView helpers).
You can add tabbed navigations, progressbars, rounded boxes etc in a snap.
All the widgets generate and inline their own CSS. Once your page is up and running you can extract and customize them as you wish.
